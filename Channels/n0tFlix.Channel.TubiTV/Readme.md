Channel works perfectly on my Ubuntu 20.04 desktop setup, biggest problem is that its loading to much content on the categories so its sloooow as hell the first time
you open a category, longest ive been waiting is 13minutes,
If anybody is having any problems or tips to fix this, please tell and hopefully we can fix it :)
